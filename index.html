Since then, Blur has evolved into an award-winning production company with work spanning the realms of game cinematics, commercials, feature films, and more.

            <p> Committed to our clients, our people and the telling of great stories, we continue to grow not only as high-end animation studio, but also as original content creators, having recently helmed Netflix’s first animated anthology, Love, Death + Robots.</p>
