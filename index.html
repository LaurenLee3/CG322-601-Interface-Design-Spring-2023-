            <h2> What does Blur Studios do? </h2>
            <p> In 1995, Tim Miller founded Blur as a studio for animators and artists to collaborate and be in control of their creative destinies. Since then, Blur has evolved into an award-winning production company with work spanning the realms of game cinematics, commercials, feature films, and more.
