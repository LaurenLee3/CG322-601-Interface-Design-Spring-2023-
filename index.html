            <h2> What is Blur Studios? </h2>
            <p> In 1995, Tim Miller founded Blur as a studio for animators and artists to collaborate and be in control
                of their creative destinies. Since then, Blur has evolved into an award-winning production company with
                work spanning the realms of game cinematics, commercials, feature films, and more. Committed to our 
                clients, our people and the telling of great stories, we continue to grow not only as high-end animation studio,
                but also as original content creators, having recently helmed Netflixs first animated anthology, Love, Death + Robots. 
            </p>
            
            <p> Blur and publisher Hi-Rez Studios kicked off the new action hero shooter, Rogue Company, with a trailer that celebrates 
                the game's wide variety of weaponry, gadgets and... fashion. Blur wrote and directed a sequence featuring characters that 
                represent the mixture of raw talent, brute force and mature finesse required to excel in Rogue Company's 4x4 tactical gameplay.

            <p> The eleven-time Emmy winning animation anthology "Love, Death & Robots" is back again on May 20th! Volume 3's nine new short films
                 might just be the most ambitious of them all. They include David Fincher's animation directorial debut with "Bad Travelling," a follow
                  up to Volume 1's "Three Robots," and another mind-bending vision called "Jibaro" from Alberto Mielgo, 2022 Oscar winner for Best
                   Animated Short Film, just to name a few.
                 Among its accolades, critical success and rabid fan base, we are most proud of the growing community of artists
                  from around the globe that have come together to put their hearts into this ground-breaking series. We are grateful 
                  to be a part of this group, and we look forward to what comes next.
